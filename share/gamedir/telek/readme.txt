Problems, please mail: "rubyprojectgoblin@hotmail.com" Any emails involving threats, pornography, or offensive material will be missed but any bug report, you will be listened to and will be added to the credit, do not report fake bugs. You do not expect another version release just because you found a bug, the creator has to make more updates than just simple updates like bug fixes unless the mod is at its end.
