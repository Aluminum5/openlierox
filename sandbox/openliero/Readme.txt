Here is the source of OpenLiero game which is exact remake of Liero v1.33 for DOS.
I've tried to import the whole game to OLX but it failed - see OlxModInterface.h and .cpp
files for how I've made simple bind between OLX and OpenLiero, and tried to implement new net engine.
This files are here as reference if I'll try to implement new netengine to OLX - 
this one was playable to some extent, and was free of self-shooting bug.
We should also include the OpenLiero physics to OpenLieroX/Hirudo at some point of time.
