- Get some more people on board!

- About 10 warnings to finish removing
 - Left shift ones are most unusual

- Remove zoidcom dependency
 - This is the hard one
 - Probably replace with OpenTNL

- A lot of refactoring
 - Rename each file after the class it contains
 - One class per file
 - Arrange namespaces into folders
 - Rename folders after libraries/namespaces

- Change source to use linux brace style
 - A lot of this can be automated
 - Just my personal style, sorry
 
- Doc comments
 - To enable comments to be pulled off with doxygen
 - As well, @todo would be nice, to correspond with this file

- Proper licensing
 - Boilerplate at the top of each file

- Remove dedicated server preprocessor directives
 - They're damned ugly
 - Instead, every game is a server
 - A local game, or a server is a client and server combination
 - Joining a remote game is just a client
 - And a dedicated server is just a server
 - But this is possibly just dreaming
 
- Update the default mod
 - More weapons!
 - More 1.33ish is the direction this should go
 - Reduce angle to somewhat like 1.33: cannot aim straight down!
