The code in this directory (and now also somewhat spread around other parts of OLX) is based on the Vermes code. It is in no way independent of the rest of OLX anymore.

This directory right now contains all the code which defines the Gusanos engine.

The Gusanos engine consists of Lua scripting, an alternative particle engine ("projectiles" in the term of LX) and an alternative physics engine.

Other parts of Gusanos like enhanced graphics effects, sound effects were heavily merged with OLX code.

FAQ by the Vermes author:

What is Vermes?
 Vermes is a fork of the popular Liero clone, Gusanos.
 
What is Liero?
 Liero is a great, fast-paced, 2D action game. With worms. And guns.
 
Why fork Gusanos?
 In a single word: liberty.

 The main reason for Vermes' existance is the use of non-free libraries in 
 Gusanos. Vermes aims to be a completely open and free Liero clone. There are 
 philosophical and esoteric reasons for this, and more practical ones. 
 Philosophically, it's nice to be in control of the software you use. 
 Practically, removing proprietary dependencies means Vermes can be integrated
 into free software projects, like operating system repositories.
 
 There are also a number of smaller reasons for the fork. A borked scons build
 system, unfriendly CVS, hard-to-get source releases, and inactive development.
 At the time Gusanos was forked, there hadn't been a release in a year. 
 Furthermore, the developers had decided to abandon the code base, to redevelop
 1.0 from scratch. Vermes decided to avoid Joel Spolsky's idea of a strategic
 mistake (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html)
 
 That's not to say anything bad about Basra and Gliptic. They've put a lot
 of work into this game. In fact, for now, 99% of the code in Vermes was 
 written by them. See CREDITS for more details.

This is some of the source code from Gusanos CVS (should be Gusanos 0.9c).

You can checkout their full CVS with these commands:

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@gusanos.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gusanos login 
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@gusanos.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gusanos co -P .

Or take a look here:
  http://gusanos.cvs.sourceforge.net/gusanos/

The code here should contain the core parts of Gusanos.

I will start to modify this code so that it can be used in OpenLieroX.

Obsolete code will be removed later.

Vermes notes:

Vermes doesn't require installation beyond putting all of its files in a 
directory somewhere. If you can read this, you're probably already ready to
play. You may want to edit default/config.cfg first, though, to set up your
nickname and key bindings.
