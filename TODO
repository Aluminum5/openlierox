TODO list

[ ] enable sound per default
[ ] remove "[RIP] Dark Charlie" profile from default :)
[ ] set other server defaultname than [RIP]
[ ] better listing of searchpaths
[ ] better bot aiming
[ ] better bot behavior
[ ] other method to get homedir (it seems that $HOME is not set in every case)
[ ] also accept ~/ in the beginning of a path-name (treat this as another variable)
[ ] cap FPS / CPU time

minor things:
[ ] save selected player list in local play and return in this menu after playing
[ ] treat ZIP-files in game-directory as virtual searchpaths
