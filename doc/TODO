TODO list

[x] enable sound per default
[x] remove "[RIP] Dark Charlie" profile from default :)
[x] set other server defaultname than [RIP]
[x] better listing of searchpaths
[ ] better bot aiming
[ ] better bot behavior
[x] other method to get homedir (it seems that $HOME is not set in every case)
[x] also accept ~/ in the beginning of a path-name (treat this as another variable)
[ ] cap FPS / CPU time

minor things:
[ ] save selected player list in local play and return in this menu after playing
[ ] treat ZIP-files in game-directory as virtual searchpaths
