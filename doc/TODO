TODO list

[ ] 16bit doesn't seem to be endian independent; fix this
[ ] fix some segfaults
[ ] fix lobby freeze (!)
{ ] make network more stable
[ ] increase FPS (and determit, why it is bad in beta2)
[ ] improve mediaplayer
[ ] improve player profile options (many skins need long load time)
[ ] make physics more like original LX (we should abstract it now!)
[x] ninja rope physic should be FPS independent
[x] fallback to software rendering on Windows on error
[ ] better bot aiming
[ ] better bot behavior
[ ] add MaxFPS option in option dialog
[ ] add some help for weapon selection (cause not everybody understand it)
[ ] add virtual filesystem for users who has inotify or who enabled it
[ ] allow more than 2 viewports
[ ] allow a higher resolution (reduce it while playing with LX56?)
[ ] join all viewports, if map is smaller than resolution
[ ] allow different sound settings (44k or 22k / mono or stereo / ...)
[ ] abstraction of the engines (network / physic / ...)

minor things:
[ ] save selected player list in local play and return in this menu after playing
[ ] treat ZIP-files in game-directory as virtual searchpaths
