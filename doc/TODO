TODO

[ ] remove all unneeded ProcessEvents() from the code
    (even net-messages through events now, so there should
     be almost no part where it is still needed) (!!)
[ ] sometimes the pathfinding returns a path through some walls
    Though mostly in this cases it's easy to go around so it
    doesn't make much trouble (mostly). But should be fixed though. (!)
    (assigned to Albert)
[ ] making general INI-parser class (!)
    (assigned to Albert)
[ ] fix for twice changing gfx options in menu (you get into trouble then) (!!)
[ ] fix network interpolation (is currently not optimal) (!!)
[ ] fix physics (behaves currently different depending on FPS) (!!)
[ ] gfx is wrong in some situation or makes problems, fix that (!!)
[ ] fix: sometimes, angle is exactly pointed to top
    but you cannot hit down to move the angle;
    also left/right (direction change) does not work
    sometimes (!!)
[ ] Fix memory leaks (!!!)
[ ] bot: go one step away if too close (!!)
[ ] bot: don't move too close if shooting is possible (!!)
[ ] follow better/faster the way (!!)
[ ] bot avoid projectiles (!!)
[ ] recode whole CTF code (!!)
[ ] fill documentation (README) (!!)
[ ] fix: crashes on MacOSX (!!)

[ ] fix dedicated server (it's often behaving a bit strange)
[ ] close stdin / pipe stream correctly for dedicated server
[?] finish mouse-aiming (!!)
[?] fix: font isn't visible in OGL on MacOSX (!!)
[?] 24/32 bit doesn't work in OpenGL mode (Mac OS X only?) (!!)
[?] are there new network errors? (!!)
[?] fix some segfaults (!!)
[?] fix physics bugs (!!)
[?] fix: sometimes you got into chat while playing online on some keys (!!)
[?] Fix the colour detection of pink for mods (255 0 255) which only
    works in 50% of the mods now. (!!)

[ ] local play menu (map selection etc.) should be faster (!)
[Â ] remove the SendMessage function from GUI part
    ( obj.SendMessage(..., GET, ...) or
      obj.SendMessage(..., SET, ...) is realy bad
      style and should be replaced by the getter/setter functions )
[x] why were some of the default-levels changed in the repo? (!!)
	The changes were done for CTF enhancements, but why was a change
	in the maps needed for a new game-type? I still don't know
	what changes are made there. Are that the locations for the flags?
	Or what else? Why is there no comment? And if it only include
	the locations why not save them in seperate files?
	( Perhaps same filename but with different file-extension. )
	( See the problem which we have by this: Perhaps later with a better
	network-engine we will check by a MD5-check of the map or so if the
	maps are equal everywhere to prevent cheeting. So a change of the
	map-file if it is still the same map should be avoided. )	
[x] cap FPS also in menu (also with WaitForNextEvent); make a new
	function CapFPS which relays perhaps on
		GetMilliseconds() - tLX->fCurTime
	and use this everywhere before WaitForNextEvent (but don't put
	it in WaitForNextEvent as it is not intended to delay).
[x] class for SDL_AddTimer as an object which can also be used
    in GUI. for example CTextbox needs it to redraw for blinking
    of cursor. an instance of this class would get timer-events
    and handle them somehow. but this timer could be also used
    for many other things.
[X] Make dual viewports work yet again. (!!)
[ ] Unify tLXOptions.tGameInfo & the other classes into one. (!)
[X] register on all servers in the masterserverlist
[ ] more options for the bots, for example restricted weapons or special
    behavior
[ ] restrict weapon settings depending on worm character
[ ] allow more than 5 weapons
[ ] configureable blood
[ ] own directory for mods -> better file management
[X] fix: map cache - carved dirt and blood stays in the map after reloading
    it from cache (maybe use CCache for caching maps?) (!!)
[X] fix: additional weapon selection keys for splitscreen for second player
[X] fix: delete key doesn't work on MacOSX (!!)
[X] don't overwrite the whole config-file at the end but only the
    known-parts (this makes it compatible with future versions and don't
    deletes part of it) (!)
[X] multiple masterservers (and registration on each) (!!)
[X] use better interpolation for remote worms (simulate with ping), client
    side (server-side impossible) (!)
[x] fix CChanel wrong ping calculations and sending packets twice when not
    wanted (!!)
[X] same caching system for GameScript as for Map (!)
[ ] create crossbuilding-scripts: (using crossbuilding in GCC)
	[ ] Mac OS X ( + Application Bundle)
	[ ] Windows EXE ( + ZIP package)
	[ ] Linux binary
		[ ] AMD64
		[ ] PPC32
		[ ] x86
		[ ] others
	[ ] Debian package
[ ] bot: more effective use of ninjarope (use closer / more intelligent
    spots) (!)
[X] bot: ninjarope is shot too fast (!!)
[x] avoid unneeded multi loading of maps (!)
[X] fix delta time (network synchronization) (!!)
[ ] new graphics engine (waytracing & pixelcache) (!)
[ ] possibility to change options when playing
[ ] uniform warning/notification/error system (!)
[X] add macro-variable to {en/dis}able the mediaplayer
[ ] standalone dedicated server (!)
[x] fill developer documentation (basic info about the code and hints) (!)
[ ] select different key for ingame console
[ ] fix lobby freeze (!)
[?] make network more stable (!)
[?] increase FPS (and determit, why it is bad in beta2)
[?] improve mediaplayer
[?] improve player profile options (many skins need long load time)
[ ] make physics more like original LX (!)
[ ] better bot aiming (fast numerical pre-physics-calculations) (!)
[ ] add option to save/load weapon selection for player
[ ] add some help for weapon selection (cause not everybody understand
    it) (!)
[ ] allow more than 2 viewports (!)
[ ] more general input-system (also with joystick-support) (!)
[ ] possibility to switch bot control / user control of a worm
[ ] allow more than one monitor (let user choose what viewports will be
    displayed on what screen)
[ ] allow a higher resolution (reduce it while playing with LX56?) (!)
[ ] join all viewports, if map is smaller than resolution (!)
[ ] allow different sound settings (44k or 22k / mono or stereo / ...) (!)
[ ] abstraction of the engines (network / physic / ...) (!)
[ ] improve join lobby, merge host lobby and join lobby code (!)
[ ] remove all non-widget drawing from menu system (create new widgets
    or use current ones) (!)

minor things:
[X] save selected player list in local play and return in this menu after
    playing (!)
[ ] treat ZIP-files in game-directory as virtual searchpaths
