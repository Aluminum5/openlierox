TODO

[ ] Make dual viewports work yet again. (!!)
[ ] Fix the colour detection of pink for mods (255 0 255) which only works in 50% of the mods now. (!!)
[ ] Unify tLXOptions.tGameInfo & the other classes into one. (!!)
[X] register on all servers in the masterserverlist
[ ] why were some of the default-levels changed in the repo? (!!)
	The changes were done for CTF enhancements, but why was a change
	in the maps needed for a new game-type? I still don't know
	what changes are made there. Are that the locations for the flags?
	Or what else? Why is there no comment? And if it only include
	the locations why not save them in seperate files?
	( Perhaps same filename but with different file-extension. )
	( See the problem which we have by this: Perhaps later with a better
	network-engine we will check by a MD5-check of the map or so if the
	maps are equal everywhere to prevent cheeting. So a change of the
	map-file if it is still the same map should be avoided. )
[ ] recode whole CTF code (!!)
[ ] more options for the bots, for example restricted weapons or special behavior
[ ] restrict weapon settings depending on worm character
[ ] allow more than 5 weapons
[ ] configureable blood
[ ] own directory for mods -> better file management
[ ] fix: map cache - carved dirt and blood stays in the map after reloading it from cache (maybe use CCache for caching maps?) (!!)
[?] fix: sometimes you got into chat while playing online on some keys
[X] fix: additional weapon selection keys for splitscreen for second player
[ ] fix: delete key doesn't work on MacOSX (!!)
[ ] don't overwrite the whole config-file at the end but only the known-parts (this makes it compatible with future versions and don't deletes part of it) (!!)
[ ] multiple masterservers (and registration on each) (!!)
[ ] use better interpolation for remote worms (simulate with ping), both server and client side (!!)
[x] fix CChanel wrong ping calculations and sending packets twice when not wanted (!!)
[ ] same caching system for GameScript as for Map (!)
[ ] create crossbuilding-scripts: (using crossbuilding in GCC)
	[ ] Mac OS X ( + Application Bundle)
	[ ] Windows EXE ( + ZIP package)
	[ ] Linux binary
		[ ] AMD64
		[ ] PPC32
		[ ] x86
		[ ] others
	[ ] Debian package
[ ] fix: font isn't visible in OGL on MacOSX (!!)
[?] 24/32 bit doesn't work in OpenGL mode (Mac OS X only?) (!!)
[ ] bot: more effective use of ninjarope (use closer / more intelligent spots) (!)
[X] bot: ninjarope is shot too fast (!!)
[ ] bot: go one step away if too close (!!)
[ ] bot: don't move too close if shooting is possible (!!)
[x] avoid unneeded multi loading of maps (!)
[X] fix delta time (network synchronization) (!!)
[x] fix physics bugs (!!)
[ ] new graphics engine (waytracing & pixelcache) (!)
[?] are there new network errors? (!!)
[ ] possibility to change options when playing
[ ] uniform warning/notification/error system (!)
[X] add macro-variable to {en/dis}able the mediaplayer
[ ] standalone dedicated server (!)
[ ] fill documentation (README) (!!)
[ ] fill developer documentation (basic info about the code and hints) (!)
[ ] select different key for ingame console
[?] fix some segfaults (!!)
[ ] fix lobby freeze (!)
[?] make network more stable (!)
[?] increase FPS (and determit, why it is bad in beta2)
[?] improve mediaplayer
[?] improve player profile options (many skins need long load time)
[ ] make physics more like original LX
[ ] better bot aiming (fast numerical pre-physics-calculations) (!)
[ ] better bot behavior (!!)
[ ] add option to save/load weapon selection
[ ] add some help for weapon selection (cause not everybody understand it) (!)
[ ] allow more than 2 viewports (!)
[ ] joystick-support (!)
[ ] possibility to switch bot control / user control of a worm
[ ] allow more than one monitor (let user choose what viewports will be displayed on what screen)
[ ] allow a higher resolution (reduce it while playing with LX56?) (!)
[ ] join all viewports, if map is smaller than resolution (!)
[ ] allow different sound settings (44k or 22k / mono or stereo / ...) (!)
[ ] abstraction of the engines (network / physic / ...) (!)
[ ] improve join lobby, merge host lobby and join lobby code (!)
[ ] remove all non-widget drawing from menu system (create new widgets or use current ones) (!)

minor things:
[ ] save selected player list in local play and return in this menu after playing (!)
[ ] treat ZIP-files in game-directory as virtual searchpaths
[ ] add virtual filesystem for users who has inotify or who enabled it
