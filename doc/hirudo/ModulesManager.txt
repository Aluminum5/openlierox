The modules manager mainly manages all the modules and their interactions. It also manages the multiple threads. So you can define with the modules manager which modules should be run in parallel and which serial.

It is itself a module and can receive control messages.

The threading-management:
For example, if you have modules M1, M2, M3, M4, M5. You can now define how they are executed. For example you can say that you have 3 threads:
	T1: M1, M3
	T2: M2, M4
	T3: M5
Or with 2 threads like this:
	T1: M1, M3, M4
	T2: M2, M5
Or only one thread:
	T1: M1, M2, M3, M4, M5
You also can define the order of the execution. For example with 2 threads, you can also define this:
	T1: M3, M4, M1
	T2: M5, M2
