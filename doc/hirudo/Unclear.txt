- How to load files likes the maps, gameobjects, etc.? Should this be a module and done via messages? Or better a seperate system for all gamedata?

- Where to hold all configurations? A special SettingsModule? Or should each engine save them by its own? Or both?

- A list of all kinds of messages needs to be done.

- Won't so many threads hit the performance? Won't it be hard to synchronize them?
