--- Okay, for now you can change anything, that note will be valid only when lot of people will play this mod. ---

You should not edit any source file in this dir, except for some non-compiling things,
like changing "unsigned" to "size_t". If you'll change any for() or while(),
the compatibility with previous clients will be dropped.
The correct way of changing things is to copy  OlxMod_OpenLiero_01.cpp to OlxMod_OpenLiero_02.cpp,
change version number from "Orthodox v0.1" to "Orthodox v0.2", and edit OlxMod_OpenLiero_02.cpp - 
add any function you need to header files, but put version number in it, like gameLoop_OlxMod_01()
instead of gameLoop().
You may also put whole thing in namespace OpenLiero, if name collisions and linker errors occur,
yet now there are none of them and I'm too lazy to do this now.
