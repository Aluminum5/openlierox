This is the game OpenLieroX!
                 ==========


	Description
	===========
It's some type of a real-time, excessive clone of Worms.


	About
	=====
OpenLieroX is based on Jason Boettchers famous Liero Xtreme.
( Take a look here: http://lxalliance.net/lierox/ )
Jason B. has released his work in 2006 under the zlib-licence
and after some months of work, we ported and enhanced his work
and got OpenLieroX.


	Compilation
	===========
Mac OS X:
HAWKNL_BUILTIN=1 CXXFLAGS="-DMACOSX" LDFLAGS="-framework Cocoa -lSDLmain" ./compile.sh


	Game search paths
	=================
The game uses case insensitive filenames (it will use the first
found on case sensitive filesystems).
The game searches the paths ~/.OpenLieroX, ./ and /usr/share/OpenLieroX
(or under Gentoo: /usr/share/games/OpenLieroX) for game-data
(all path are relativ to this bases) (in this order) by default.
You can also add more searchpathes and change this in cfg/options.cfg.
Own modified configs, screenshots and other stuff always will
be stored in ~/.OpenLieroX.


	Thanks for all the fish
