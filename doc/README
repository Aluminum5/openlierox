This is the game OpenLieroX!

It's some type of a real-time, excessive clone of Worms.

OpenLieroX is based on Jason Boettchers famous Liero Xtreme.
( Take a look here: http://lxalliance.net/lierox/ )
Jason B. has released his work in 2006 under the zlib-licence
and after some months of work, we ported and enhanced his work
and got OpenLieroX.

Yes I know, this README is very empty at the moment :)
(perhaps later, this will be changed)

So, well, what should I say...

Thank you for enjoying it!
