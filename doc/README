This is the game OpenLieroX!

It's some type of a real-time, excessive clone of Worms.

OpenLieroX is based on Jason Boettchers famous Liero Xtreme.
( Take a look here: http://lxalliance.net/lierox/ )
Jason B. has released his work in 2006 under the zlib-licence
and after some months of work, we ported and enhanced his work
and got OpenLieroX.

The game uses case insensitive filenames (it will use the first
found on case sensitive filesystems).
The game searches the paths ~/.OpenLieroX, ./ and /usr/share/OpenLieroX
(or under Gentoo: /usr/share/games/OpenLieroX) for game-data
(all path are relativ to this bases) (in this order).
You can also add more searchpathes in cfg/options.cfg
(you also can change the searchpath-order here).
Own modified configs, screenshots and other stuff always will
be stored in ~/.OpenLieroX.

So, well, I think that was all the important stuff.
Look at the Homepage for further details.
