This is the game OpenLieroX!
                 ==========


	Description
	===========
It's some type of a real-time, excessive clone of Worms.


	About
	=====
OpenLieroX is based on Jason Boettchers famous Liero Xtreme.
( Take a look here: http://lxalliance.net/lierox/ )
Jason B. has released his work in 2006 under the zlib-licence
and after some months of work, we ported and enhanced his work
and got OpenLieroX.


	Compilation
	===========
There are 2 ways to compile the game. The easier one is to use
the compile.sh script, which do everything for you. Take a look
inside for additional options. Basically, you have to call
	./compile.sh
or for example, if you want to have HawkNL support builtin (it
would be linked against otherwise)
	HAWKNL_BUILTIN=1 ./compile.sh

If you want to develop on the source, I recommend you to use the
CMake-based make-system we use. You have to install CMake on your
system and then call
	cmake .
This will create you a Makefile so you can simply call
	make
now for your compilation. But note that the CMakeLists.txt (the
base file for CMake) is experimental. It's possible that you
have to change the file a bit depending on your environment.

Macro-variables of the source:
	WITH_MEDIAPLAYER - if set, mediaplayer support will be built in
	MACOSX - activates some special settings for Mac OS X
	DEBUG - if set to 1, debugging is activated
	
Mac OS X: (experimental)
	HAWKNL_BUILTIN=1 CXXFLAGS="-DMACOSX" \
	LDFLAGS="-framework Cocoa -lSDLmain" ./compile.sh


	Game search paths
	=================
The game uses case insensitive filenames (it will use the first
found on case sensitive filesystems).
The game searches the paths ~/.OpenLieroX, ./ and /usr/share/OpenLieroX
(or under Gentoo: /usr/share/games/OpenLieroX) for game-data
(all path are relativ to this bases) (in this order) by default.
You can also add more searchpathes and change this in cfg/options.cfg.
Own modified configs, screenshots and other stuff always will
be stored in ~/.OpenLieroX.


	Thanks for all the fish

So, well, I think that was all the important stuff.
Look at the Homepage for further details.
