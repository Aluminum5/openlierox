- more correct projectile simulation
- experimental file transfer support
- delete-key works now under MacOSX
- more keys got recognised
  (super and meta keys, that includes also the
  Apple-key on a Mac)

==========
- 16/24/32 bit graphic support and OpenGL support
- runs on MacOSX 
- new design & icon (thanks goes to Raziel)
- probably fixed any saving-problem
  (problem was: sometimes SDL_Quit gives a segfault
  and saving was done after this; now it's done before)
- full Unicode/UTF8 support
- font antialasing support
- working Dev-C++ project (therefore MingW support)
- MaxFPS in option-dialog
- Worm AI improvements
- ninjarope physic simulation is FPS independent
- profile-saving is correct now


0.57_beta2
==========
- BPP independent
- ingame mediaplayer
- 64bit version works now
- more fixes, general improvements, etc.
- code cleanups (replacements with C++/STL technics)
- whole project uses std::string now (realy huge change)
- collision-checks are improved (more like the original LX, that
  means, it goes at least through walls with ~3px width)
- chatbox improvements
- unlimited number of bots in net play
- ~/ at the beginning of a searchpath is handled correctly and there
  is a more correct method to get the homedir
- MaxFPS option under [Advanced] in ~/.OpenLieroX/cfg/options.cfg
- fixed compile-issues on 64bit systems
- no-clipping-issues with weapon-generated dirt are fixed


0.57_beta1
==========
- POSIX-compatible (well-tested under Linux).
- endian-independent (runs without any problems on my big endian PPC)
- a _huge_ amount of bug-fixes
- the old BASS soundsystem was replaced by SDL_mixer
- new file handling routines
  (1. based on searchpaths; 2. case-insensitive handling)
- new bot AI with a very nice pathfinding-algo
- some other additions/extensions/...
- ...
